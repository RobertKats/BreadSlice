# IOU

This is a simple app to help split bills with friends, that calculates the tax on each item and not the whole order.

# Intro
Have you ever been stuck figuring out who owes who what at the end of a fun food outing with friends?

Introducing IOU, an innovative app designed do all those pesky calculations for you!

Just input who ordered what, for what price, the tax and tip. The app will then calcuate the total for each user.

# Notes
This is my first flutter app. While the main page is fully functional, it still needs a bit of refactoring to implement the best pratices of flutter design.

The save page UI and some features are still under development.
